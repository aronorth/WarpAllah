## **Features**
- **Warp Unbound Talent Bug Hotfix**
  - Fixes a bug affecting the Electrokinetic Staff, Purgatus Staff, and Smite; where you can still explode during a small time-interval even if Warp Unbound is activated.
  - Prevents unexpected explosions by disabling additional inputs which would generate peril for a small time window when the bug usually occurs.
---

## **Disclaimer**
- **Bugs**  
  - Possible to still explode with Assail, if spam-throwing knives while just below 100% peril.
  - Transition between preventing & allowing inputs cancels holding-down inputs (so you gotto repress the button)

- **Warp Unbound Bug Fix**  
  - Default settings values is what worked for me
  - There's can still still persist a small probability of the bug occurring.  
  - You can tweak the settings to potentially find better values.
